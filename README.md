# PLEASE READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The solution files for the challenge problem are located at ec/bt-postfix directory.


You can also look at my Rubix files... but they're not even close to complete. The idea was to make a Rubix cube, randomly scramble it, and then try to solve it using the A* algorithm. However, it too time consuming for me to do for an extra credit assignment, so I leave it to you if you want to impelement it as a future homework assignment. 

Welcome to my github page! :)
