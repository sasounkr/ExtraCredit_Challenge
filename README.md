# The Challenge Problem
In HW2, we were asked to implement a program that evaluates an expression. However, for the sake of simplification, the implementation did not account for operator precedence. What I mean by this is that our program doesn't understand how to evaluate something like "1+2x3". A human would easily know to evaluate 2x3 to 6, then add 1+6, with a final result of 7. The challenge is to make an expression evaluator using a binary tree.


side note:
You can also look at my Rubix files... but they're not even close to complete. The idea was to make a Rubix cube, randomly scramble it, and then try to solve it using the A* algorithm. However, it is too time consuming for me to do for an extra credit assignment, so I leave it to you if you want to impelement it as a future homework assignment.
