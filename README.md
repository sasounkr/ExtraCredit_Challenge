# The Challenge Problem
**Context**:
  In HW2, we were asked to implement a program that evaluates an expression. However, for the sake of simplification, the implementation did not account for operator precedence. What I mean by this is that our program doesn't understand how to evaluate something like "1+2x3". A human would easily know to evaluate 2x3 to 6, then add 1+6, with a final result of 7. 
  The type of expression we see in our daily lives is called an "infix expression". Unfortunately, computers can't really make sense of infix expressions, but, they can easily evaluate what's called a postfix expression. In a postfix expression, most of the operators go to the right of the operands. For example, "1+2x3" would become "123x+", and "1x2+3" would be "12x3+".
  
 **Actual Problem**:
  In your impelementation, given a valid expression, you will convert the expression into a binary tree, and then once you do that, you will use the postfix evaluation algorithm(a very simple algorithm) to evaluate an expression.
  
 **1st Part(harder part): setting up the binary tree**
 

side note:
You can also look at my Rubix files... but they're not even close to complete. The idea was to make a Rubix cube, randomly scramble it, and then try to solve it using the A* algorithm. However, it is too time consuming for me to do for an extra credit assignment, so I leave it to you if you want to impelement it as a future homework assignment.
